# Registration for React app

## Description

Just a small full-stack exercise from DCI one year web developer course.

Demo of the registration in the react app:

- Possibilities of register (e-mail has to be unique) and login

- logged user can change password

- logged user can also change profile photo (usage of multer package)

- basic verification by registration using express-validator

No final product - no special styling (just basic bootstrap), no cleanly ordered code, etc. just playground.

Full stack with Express.js backend and MongoDB database, backend part is [MongoDB-Playground repository](https://github.com/Alice-Rez/MongoDB-Playground).

Passwords are not correctly handled yet, so this exercise do not show correct way how to handle passwords!

## Setup

1. clone this repository as well as [MongoDB-Playground repository](https://github.com/Alice-Rez/MongoDB-Playground)
2. instal all dependencies using ` npm install` in both of the cloned repositories
3. start server by `nodemon start`
4. start frontend part by `npm start`
5. enjoy exploring of the application

## Acknowledgement

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

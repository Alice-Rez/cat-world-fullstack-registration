# Registration for React app

## Description

Just a small full-stack exercise from DCI one year web developer course.

Demo of the registration in the react app:

- Possibilities of register (e-mail has to be unique) and login

- logged user can change password

- logged user can also set/change profile photo (usage of multer package) - not working in deployed version at heroku

- basic verification by registration using express-validator

No final product - no special styling (just basic bootstrap), no cleanly ordered code, etc. just playground.

Full stack with Express.js backend and MongoDB database.

Passwords are not correctly handled yet, so this exercise do not show correct way how to handle passwords!

## Setup

1. clone this repository
2. instal all dependencies using ` npm install` in root and `client`
3. start server in root by `nodemon start`
4. start frontend part in `client` by `npm start`
5. enjoy exploring of the application

## Acknowledgement
